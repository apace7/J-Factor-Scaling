# J-Factor-Scaling

Repository for J-Factor posteriors.
For details on methodology see http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06811.  The majority of the J-Factors were calculated in this project.
If you use these J-Factors please cite http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06811.

(2019-09-23) Added J-Factors for three additional dwarfs : Sagittarius II, Crater II, Hydrus I.  See (arxiv goes here) for more details.  If you use these please cite http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06811 and new arvix.

Included are corner plots, and posteriors (chains).
