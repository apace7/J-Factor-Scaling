# J-Factor-Scaling

Repository for J-Factor posteriors.  For details on methodology see http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06811.

J-factors for 41 dwarfs are included (extra plots, chains/posteriors).
Plots for J-factor scaling relations are also included.
If you use these J-Factors please cite http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06811.

repo_1909_xxxxx:
(2019-09-23) Added J-Factors for three additional dwarfs : Sagittarius II, Crater II, Hydrus I.  See (arxiv goes here) for more details.
Included are plots and chains/posteriors (repo_1909_xxxxx/new_dwarfs)
J-factors (velocity dependent) for s-wave, p-wave, d-wave, and Sommerfeld enhanced (repo_1909_xxxxx/Jfactors)
If you use these please cite http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06811 and new arxiv.
